	abstract = {Policymakers are concerned by evidence that noncompete agreements (NCAs) are widely used in low-wage jobs. We show that firms that would otherwise not use NCAs are induced to use one in the presence of frictions to adjusting wages downward. Using a new survey of salon owners, we find that declines in the terms of trade for employees and increases in the minimum wage lead to higher NCA use, but only at firms for which the employee’s cost of an NCA likely exceeds the employer’s benefit.
Furthermore, minimum wage increases have a negative effect on employment only where NCAs are unenforceable.},

	abstract = {We analyze how the legal enforceability of noncompete agreements (NCAs) affects labor markets. Using newly-constructed panel data, we find that higher NCA enforceability diminishes workers’ earnings and job mobility, with larger effects among workers most likely to sign NCAs. These effects are far-reaching: increasing enforceability imposes externalities on workers across state borders, suggesting broad effects on labor market dynamism. We show enforceability affects wages by reducing outside options and preventing workers from leveraging tight labor markets to increase earnings. We motivate these findings with a model of search and bargaining. Finally, higher NCA enforceability exacerbates gender and racial earnings gaps.},

	abstract = {This paper provides evidence from a natural experiment on the importance of workers' tacit knowledge about firms' intangible assets for competition in product and labor markets. Evidence is presented on product and labor market imperfections across manufacturing and services firms in the Netherlands. Price-cost markups and wage markups are both shown to be positively related to intangible intensity at the firm level. A model is developed of the processes of intangible investment and wage bargaining of heterogeneous firms, providing a mechanism that relates workers' tacit knowledge to firm-level product and labor market imperfections. The model also incorporates a role for non-compete agreements (NCAs) limiting worker mobility. Our main empirical contribution comes from using linked employer-employee panel data with information on NCAs and changes in enforceability of these agreements. Using an event-study framework, we demonstrate that the removal of NCAs leads to higher wages and worker mobility, especially for workers in intangible-intensive firms. We find that NCAs affect workers across the skill distribution. The causal findings from changes in the legality of NCAs correspond with the mechanism described in the model.},
