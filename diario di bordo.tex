\section*{Validity of Noncompete clauses}

We want to explore whether there is some interesting correlation between the mismatch betweeen worker and employer incidence values, and the validity of the Noncompete clauses reported. By exploiting an elaboration from OECD on the legislative framework of the countries of our dataset, we seek to create one dummy variable for each country, indicating whether the clause is legal or not(or whether it is ambiguous). The first step is to lie down, if available, relevant criteria that can be cross-checked within out dataset, in order to create such dummies. In the following list we report, for each country, the information that we have on the legal framework, and we proposed the parameters that we can use to create the dummies.

\subsubsection*{Belgium}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\small
\begin{tabular}{|p{0.35\textwidth}|p{0.6\textwidth}|}
\hline
\textbf{Dimension/Question} & \textbf{Short answer} \\
\hline
1. Statute of general applicability & Article 65, \S 1, and Article 86, \S 1, Employment Contracts Act. Maximum duration 12 months. \\
\hline
2. Role of collective agreements & The Belgian Employment Contracts Act expressly refers collective bargaining agreements to regulate non-compete clauses under some circumstances (e.g., if the salary is between Euro 43,106 and 86,212, a non-compete is valid only for those occupations whose collective agreement, signed at joint committee level, regulates the use of non-compete clauses). However, only a few joint committees have stipulated a collective agreement regulating non-compete clauses. \\
\hline
3. Employer's protectable interest & The covenant must cover similar activities (in terms of the type of business, as well as based on the employee's occupation and tasks performed). By exploiting special knowledge, peculiar to, and acquired in that enterprise, there must be a possibility that the enterprise is harmed. \\
\hline
4. Compensation & Minimum compensation 50\% of gross salary. \\
\hline
5. Change in terms/continued employment sufficient consideration & No specified circumstances, but employees need to agree to sign the agreement. \\
\hline
6. Plaintiff burden of proof & Non-compete must be reasonable, within certain boundaries set by the regulatory framework (including wage thresholds). \\
\hline
7. Modification or blue pencil & Blue pencil or modification not allowed. \\
\hline
8. Enforceability in case of dismissal & Article 65, \S 2 of the Employment Contracts Act provides that a non-compete is unenforceable if the contract is terminated either during the first six months from the commencement of the employment contract, after such period, by the employer without urgent cause on the part of the employee, or by the employee due to urgent cause on the part of the employer. \\
\hline
9. Sanctions & Employers are not subject to sanctions if they use unenforceable non-compete clauses \\
\hline

\subsubsection*{France}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\small
\begin{tabular}{|p{0.35\textwidth}|p{0.6\textwidth}|}
\hline
\textbf{Dimension/Question} & \textbf{Short answer} \\
\hline
1. Statute of general applicability & In the absence of a statute regulating non-compete clauses, courts have played a significant role in defining the boundaries of enforceability. \\
\hline
2. Role of collective agreements & Evidence suggests that collective agreements play a role in regulating non-compete clauses in France, both at the firm and sectoral level. \\
\hline
3. Employer's protectable interest & A non-compete must be essential to protect the employer's legitimate interests. Moreover, the employer must be able to demonstrate the likelihood of actual harm if the employee engages in competitive activity. \\
\hline
4. Compensation & Specific compensation is required. \\
\hline
5. Change in terms/continued employment sufficient consideration & No specified circumstances, but employees need to agree to sign the agreement. \\
\hline
6. Plaintiff burden of proof & Non-compete clauses must be reasonable, within certain boundaries set by the regulatory framework. \\
\hline
7. Modification or blue pencil & When faced with a non-compete clause included in an employment contract, the judge may limit its application by restricting its effect in terms of time, geographical scope, or other conditions when the clause prevents the employee from pursuing an activity in line with their skills and experience. \\
\hline
8. Enforceability in case of dismissal & The enforceability of a non-compete is not linked to the reason for the termination of the employment relationship. \\
\hline
9. Sanctions & The sanction for the illegality of a - is its nullity, and where applicable, compensation for the employee who has suffered harm. \\

\hline
3. Employer's protectable interest & The covenant must be reasonable in scope and protect legitimate business interests \\
\hline

Enforceability in case of dismissal & According to Article 75 of the Commercial Code, in case of dismissal without prior notice, the non-compete is unenforceable if the party who terminates the contract declares within one month upon termination that they want to be released. If the employee terminates the contract, she remains bound by the non-competition clause subject to a mutually agreed termination. If the employer terminates the employment contract, the employee may be released from the non-competition clause, provided that the termination was not due to a significant personal reason, or the employer agrees to pay compensation in the amount of the full contractual remuneration for the duration of the non-competition clause. \\
\hline
9. Sanctions & Employers are not subject to sanctions if they use unenforceable non-compete clauses. \\
